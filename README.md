Notes On Learning CUDA-C Programming

## Motivation:  
I record my thoughts/notes/summary on CUDA-C Programming in this repo. Most of notes come from [ZheyongFan](https://zheyongfan.org/index.php/Main_Page)'s awesome [CUDA-Programming](https://github.com/brucefan1983/CUDA-Programming) repo and his [published book](https://book.douban.com/subject/35252459/).

## Some References

### A short overview on CUDA-C Programming

I write a [blog article](https://jieli-matrix.github.io/cuda01/) which involves some aspects:
- Architecture history from CPU to GPU
- Introduction to physical architecture of GPU 
- Relation between GPU's architecture and software concepts 
- Bullets of CUDA-C Programming 

### CUDA Programming and Applications in Julia

[Julia2021Con](https://juliacon.org/2021/) is opening recently and there are two workshops about CUDA I highly recommended:
- [GPU programming in Julia](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2021/talk/VK87Q3/)
- [Solving differential equations in parallel on GPUs](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2021/talk/CPH7SG/)

Thanks to these speakers, related workshop material could be accessed by github:
